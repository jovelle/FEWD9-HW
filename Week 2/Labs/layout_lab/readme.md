##Layout Lab

---

**Instructions** : Using the techniques we've discussed in class, try to reproduce the first two layouts shown in the layouts.pdf file (two column and three column layouts). 

You can use floats or inline-block to reproduce each layout. If you use floats, remember to clear or contain them. If you use inline-block elements, remember to use `calc` to determine their correct widths. Remember also to eliminate any space between inline block elements in your html (you can use `<-- -->` do do this)

Try making your layouts as responsive as possible. If you complete the first two layouts early, feel free to try the more challenging layouts shown in the file.
