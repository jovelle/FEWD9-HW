##Review Exercise

---

**Instructions** :  Check out the review_exercise.png file. Try to use what you've learned over the last two weeks to reproduce the web page you see in the image. Some basic starter code is provided for you in the index.html file, and notes covering the major topics we've discussed so far can be found in the review_notes.md file.

If you're having trouble getting started, try out these suggestions:

* Look at the page in the review_exeriise.png file and try to break it down into its constituent parts. Where does the header start? What elements could be used to make it? What part of the page is the main body and does it have any sub-parts?
* Create a `<div>` and give it a class of "container". Put everything inside of this `<div>`, header, body, and footer. You can five this container a fixed width and then center it on the page using the `margin: 0 auto` technique we learned Tuesday

**Bonus** :  Try to construct the page with semantic html elements where possible--this means using `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc. instead of a bunch of `<div>`s

**Super Bonus** : Try to use properties like `max-width` or `min-width` to make the page responsive, so that it grows and shrinks as the browser window is resized.s
