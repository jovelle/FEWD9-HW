##Code Review / Warmup

---

###Instructions
This starter code contains a folder of images and a text file. The text file contains copy for an "about me" page. Use this copy to create an html page that you can view in the browser. To get started:

* copy and paste the sample copy into about.html
* add html markup to the text
* insert an image in the appropriate place (hint: you'll need the `<img>` tag to do this; if you don't know how to use it, try to google and find out)
* divide the title of the page from the content with a horizontal line (hint: you can use the `<hr>` tag to do this) 
* create a file called `style.css`, link it with your html files, and add some basic styling.
